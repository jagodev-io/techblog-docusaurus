## useState: Managing State in Functional Components

The `useState` hook is the cornerstone of state management in functional components. Let's look at a simple example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
